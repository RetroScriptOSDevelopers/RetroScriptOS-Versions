First up if you want to modify things for the public ask in the RetroScript Discussion linked in the description of this GitHub project
and if we accept we shall add it, and if not you can create a remix and publish it with at the end of the name writen: But my version.

You can use turbowarp packager to make it .exe html and other things, when you try the OS use turbo mode for a better experience on an 
Operative System on Scratch!
